# Baamageddon
* Modify Load and Save data strategy for Cradle
* Move Attribute from MainGame.cpp to MainGame.hpp
* Add GameObject folder for All new GameObject hpp
* Enabled LFS for Repo
* Add VS .gitignore
## Achieved Feature (Editor and MainGame)
* Add Spikes & Spinning Blade 
* Add Exit Doughnut and Sprinker
* Add Bouncy Bushes & Left Right Wolf
* Add Hold to Jump Higher
* Add SwingingBlade (Move Sprite Origin)
* Add Bouce strength for Paltform (Don't know why platform id changed after creating)
* Customize Cradle for Editor, modify Load and Save Strategy
* Add Cradle Walkable and trigger damage feature (fail to add swing)
### ↓ Some idea for cradle ↓
- Maybe kind of same like SwingingBlade need to move origin?
- I'm tring to packup Cradle as a class and make hierachy
